This repo is where I host all my *samenvattingen* (**summaries**) and a list of other learning resources. The summaries are written in Markdown, converted to HTML with Jekyll, and hosted using GitHub Pages.

I used to use Google Docs for everything, but managing and sharing files got annoying (plus I really wanted to use LaTeX). Summaries made before 4VWO P3 weren't originally in Markdown, so their formatting might be a bit off.

The idea to move everything to Markdown and GitHub Pages came from seeing [Robin](https://github.com/RobinBoers)'s [*amazing* site with his own summaries](https://github.com/RobinBoers/school.geheimesite.nl), so huge thanks to him!
