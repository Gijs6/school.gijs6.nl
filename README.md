The *famous* place I dump all my school summaries.

## How shit works

[`binder.py`](binder.py) is a custom simple ssg that deals with the build output, templating and feeds.

## Running locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

bake serve  # dev server
bake build  # static site
```

> The `bake` command is just a simple alternative to `make`. To use it, install [`bake`](https://git.dupunkto.org/~meta/dotfiles/blob/master/bin/bake) in your `PATH`.  
> Or just run the Python commands directly: `python binder.py serve` or `python binder.py build`.
