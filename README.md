This repo is the place I host all my *samenvattingen* (**summaries**) and just a list of all other learning resources. I got tired of using Google Docs and sharing the files and stuff (and I really wanted to be able to use LaTeX), so here I am. The summaries are now in markdown files and they are made into HTML's by Jekyll and then hosted via GitHub Pages.

All summaries made before 4VWO P3 were not initally made in markdown, so they may not be converted to markdown that well.

I got the idea of moving my summaries to markdown and on GitHub Pages when I saw that [Robin](https://github.com/RobinBoers) had this [*amazing* site with his own summaries](https://github.com/RobinBoers/school.geheimesite.nl), so huge thanks to him!
