This repo is the place I host all my *samenvattingen*. I got tired of using Google Docs, so here I am. The *samenvattingen* are now in markdown files and they are made into HTML's by Jekyll and then hosted via GitHub Pages.

All samenvattingen made before 4VWO P3 were not initally made in markdown, so they may not be converted to markdown that well.

I got the idea of moving my *samenvattingen* to markdown and on GitHub Pages when I saw that [Robin](https://github.com/RobinBoers) had this [*amazing* site with his own *samenvattingen*](https://github.com/RobinBoers/school.geheimesite.nl), so huge thanks to him!
