# docs.gijs6.nl

This repo is the place I host all my *samenvattingen*. I got tired of using Google Docs, so here I am. The *samenvattingen* are now in markdown files and they are made into HTML's by Jekyll and then hosted via GitHub Pages.

All samenvattingen made before 4VWO P3 were not initally made in markdown, so they may not be converted to markdown that well.

I got the idea of moving my *samenvattingen* to markdown and on GitHub Pages when I saw that [Robin](https://github.com/RobinBoers) had this [*amazing* site with his own *samenvattingen*](https://github.com/RobinBoers/school.geheimesite.nl), so huge thanks to him!

## TO DO

- [ ] Add toetscode to all front matter things
- [ ] Add thing for docs that arent samva's (a type in the front matter or something?) and add it to the autodatageneratorstuffthings (so in the front matter still link to a test code but add a type and in the py make it first check if that type is there and just add it to the resources i guess but also add if it is not added to a test code and then just use the file path to add it somewhere to the homepage data and get the subject and stuff from the front matter)
- [ ] Add interface for easily adding resources
