## Désirée's Baby

**Désirée's Baby**, written by Kate Chopin in 1893, follows a woman who is rejected by her husband after their baby appears to have Black ancestry. The story is set on a Louisiana plantation before the American Civil War and explores themes of racial identity and prejudice.

### Historical context

The story is set before the American Civil War (1861-1865) during the **Antebellum** period (1820-1855). During this period, there was significant tension between the Northern and Southern states. Northern states were free states where slavery was prohibited, while slavery was still practiced in the Southern states. This created growing conflict between the states, eventually leading to the American Civil War. The Northern states won the war, and slavery was abolished (but racism persisted).

Chopin was a part of the **Louisiana creole social elite**. These were wealthy families who came from French and Spanish settlers. They kept their European culture, traditions and language.

### Summary

Désirée is the adopted daughter of Monsieur and Madame Valmondé. When she was a baby, she was found abandoned in the shadow of a stone pillar by Monsieur Valmondé. Désirée marries Armand Aubigny, and they have a child together. Armand was a slave owner, but he became kinder and softer after he married Désirée and after they had the baby. However, after a few months, Armand's behavior suddenly changes. He avoids being with the baby and becomes very harsh toward the slaves again.  
One afternoon, Désirée is in her room when she notices that her baby looks a lot like one of the quadroons (a person who is 1/4 Black). Armand enters her room and accuses Désirée of not being white (because her heritage is unknown, since she was found abandoned).  
Désirée writes to her mother, who tells her she should come home with the baby. Armand also tells her to leave. Désirée leaves with the baby, and she is never seen again.  
A few weeks later, Armand burns all of Désirée's belongings. In the drawer where the letters between Armand and Désirée were kept, he finds a letter from his mother to his father, revealing that Armand is the one who is part Black.

### Themes

- **Identity** and **ethnicity**  
  Identity and ethnicity are portrayed as the most important aspects of a person. For example, Armand sends away Désirée and the baby purely because of ethnicity.
- **Racism**
- **Love/marriage**
- **Sexism**

## The Yellow Wallpaper

**The Yellow Wallpaper**, written by Charlotte Perkins Gilman in 1892, is an important work of feminist literature. The story follows a woman who is forced to undergo a rest cure for her postpartum depression and slowly descends into madness. It's told through first-person journal entries.

### Historical context

The story is set during the **fin de siècle** (end of century) period. This period was characterized by **decay**, **anxiety**, and **fear of the future**.
People began to question the authority of religion, morality, and traditional gender roles. There was a growing fascination with the mind and dreams.

### Summary

A young woman and her husband (John) spend the summer at a mansion, where the narrator is confined to an upstairs nursery. Her husband had imposed a **rest cure** on her after she suffered a **postpartum depression** (depression after giving birth). John is belittling of her illness and dismissive of her perspective. He believes she is not really sick. The woman keeps a secret journal to "relieve her mind."

The woman develops an obsession with the yellow wallpaper in the nursery. She finds the pattern disturbing. John worries about her obsession and refuses to replace the wallpaper.
As her obsession grows, the sub-pattern of the wallpaper begins to resemble a woman "stooping down and creeping."

Her obsession intensifies. She believes the wallpaper is moving, and her imagination becomes completely focused on it. She is losing touch with reality. She can smell the paper throughout the whole house. She believes that a woman trapped inside the paper is making it move. She descends into total madness and even sees that woman outside her window. She starts to identify with the woman in the wallpaper.

She starts peeling off the wallpaper during the night because she suspects that John knows about her obsession. The next day, she starts biting and tearing the paper to free the trapped woman inside.
By the end, the woman has gone completely insane. She is convinced that there are many women creeping around, and that she herself has come out of the wallpaper. When John breaks into the locked room and sees the full horror of the situation, he faints in the doorway.

### Themes

- **Mental health and insanity**  
  The story shows how the rest cure and isolation drive the narrator to madness. Her descent into insanity is portrayed through her obsession with the wallpaper.
- **The rest cure**  
  The rest cure was a real medical treatment prescribed to women in the 19th century. The story criticizes this treatment by showing how it worsens the narrator's condition instead of curing it. Charlotte Perkins Gilman herself was placed on a rest cure after suffering from postpartum depression. She wrote this story as a critique of the treatment and to raise awareness about its harmful effects.
- **Gender roles**  
  John dismisses his wife's concerns and he controls every aspect of her life. The collapse of John at the end symbolizes the collapse of his power.
- **Freedom**  
  The woman in the wallpaper represents the narrator's desire to break free from her confinement. By tearing down the wallpaper, she symbolically frees herself.
- **Perception vs. reality**  
  Because the narrator is unreliable, readers are forced to question what is real and what is her imagination. Her changing perception of the wallpaper reflects her deteriorating mental state.

## Frankenstein

**Frankenstein**, written by Mary Shelley in 1818, is a Gothic novel often considered one of the first works of science fiction. The novel explores the dark side of scientific progress: a young scientist creates a living creature from dead body parts, but when society rejects the creature, it turns to violence. The story examines themes of ambition, isolation, revenge, and the responsibilities of creation.

### Gothic writing

Gothic literature is characterized by fear, horror, death and gloom, combined with romantic elements such as nature, individuality and emotion. It emerged as a reaction to the **Age of Reason** (*verlichting*), emphasizing the dark side of human progress and its limits rather than celebrating scientific advancement. Gothic writing focuses on what cannot be explained by logic and science, exploring the supernatural and the unknown. Death and nature are portrayed as forces superior to humans. The typical **Gothic hero** is a romantic figure who rejects social norms and conventions, but is also rejected by society.

### Summary

Victor Frankenstein, a young scientist, succeeds in creating a living being from dead body parts. However, when he sees what he has created, he is horrified and abandons the creature. The creature is left alone to discover the world by himself.

Later, at the top of a mountain in the Swiss Alps, Frankenstein encounters the creature again. Frankenstein calls him a devil and threatens to kill him, but the creature begs Frankenstein to listen to his story. He tells him that society has rejected him and he has been miserable since his creation.

When the creature wakes up, he does not understand anything. He slowly learns to use his senses, fire and how to find food. When he first meets people, they scream or attack him because of his appearance.

Eventually, the creature finds a small hut next to a cottage and hides there. From inside, he watches a poor family: an old blind man (De Lacey), a young man (Felix) and a young woman (Agatha). The creature notices they are kind and loving to each other, even though they are sad. He admires them and feels joy from watching their happiness, but also pain from realising he can never be part of their world because of how people have treated him.

The creature doesn't understand why Felix and Agatha cry so much, because he thinks they have everything they need, but eventually, he realises they are poor. He stops stealing their food and instead eats berries from the forest. To help them, he secretly gathers firewood and leaves it at their door.

The creature starts learning about speech and picks up a couple of words, including the family's names.

As spring arrives, the family's situation improves. The creature continues to secretly help them and study them. He imagines that if he could first master their language, they might not care about his appearance and accept him.

One day, a woman (Safie) wearing a dark veil arrives at the cottage. When Felix sees her, he is very happy. She doesn't speak the family's language, but is welcomed anyway. She tries to learn from the cottagers, and the creature learns with her. Felix gives her lessons and reads her *Ruins of Empires*. Through these lessons, the creature learns about human society, wealth, poverty, kings, slaves, good and evil. He becomes both fascinated and troubled, because humans can be both kind and cruel.
He realises he has no family, no money, no friends and a frightening appearance.

The creature begins to understand love, family and human relations. The more he learns, the more miserable he becomes. He finds that knowledge only brings pain. But he still adores the cottagers (he calls them "my protectors") who represent everything beautiful and good to him.

---

The creature also learns the family's story.
The old man used to be wealthy and respected in France. His son (Felix) and Agatha grew up wealthy and lived in Paris.

Their happiness ended because of Safie's father (a Turkish merchant), who was imprisoned by the French government. Felix saw the trial, was outraged by the injustice and dedicated himself to rescuing him. When visiting the merchant in prison, Safie expressed gratitude to Felix, who was moved by her beauty. Her father promised they could marry if Felix saved him.

Felix succeeded and guided them from Paris through France and Italy. Safie and Felix grew close, but her father intended to take her back to Turkey. When Felix was exiled, Safie left Italy alone with money and jewels. Her helper died on the way, but she finally reached safety near the cottage.

---

Around August, the creature finds some books in the woods: *Paradise Lost*, *Plutarch's Lives*, and *The Sorrows of Werter*. From *Paradise Lost*, he learns about religion and spirituality, but takes it as "true history" rather than fiction. From *Plutarch's Lives*, he learns about society and the importance of perspective and education. From *The Sorrows of Werter*, he learns about domestic life, death and darker emotions.

He also finds Frankenstein's journal describing his creation. Reading it fills him with horror and despair as he sees himself as a monstrous, abandoned being, unlike any human.

The family grows happier, especially with Safie's arrival. The creature's knowledge increases, but so does his awareness of his appearance. In the winter, he plans to reveal himself when the blind old man is alone, hoping his blindness will allow him to judge the creature by words rather than appearance.

The creature nervously approaches the cottage and asks for shelter. De Lacey speaks kindly and offers help. The creature tells him of his loneliness, hoping to gain the family's trust. But then, Felix, Agatha and Safie return and are horrified: Agatha faints, Safie runs away and Felix attacks him. The creature escapes to his hut, heartbroken and rejected. He thinks they might still accept him if he approaches more carefully, but when he returns, the cottage is deserted. Out of revenge, he sets it on fire.

The creature curses his creator for giving him life and declares eternal hate toward humanity and Frankenstein. He travels towards Frankenstein's home in Geneva, suffering from hunger, cold and loneliness. At one point, he saves a drowning girl, but instead of gratitude, a man shoots him.

Near Geneva, the creature meets a small boy. He hopes the boy won't fear him, but the boy screams, calls him a monster and reveals his father is Frankenstein. The creature kills the boy, finds a picture of a woman on him and plants it on another woman to frame her for the murder.

At the end, the creature tells Frankenstein he will not stop his violence unless Frankenstein creates a female companion for him.

### Themes

- **Supernatural**  
  Creating life from dead matter defies the natural order and represents the Gothic fascination with what lies beyond human understanding.
- **Emotions**  
  The story emphasizes emotions over rationality. The creature shows that emotions are fundamental to existence.
- **Knowledge**  
  The creature discovers that knowledge only brings pain.
- **Revenge**  
  Rejection drives the creature to revenge.
- **Criticism of society**  
  Society judges by appearance rather than character. Despite his intelligence and goodness, the creature is rejected purely because of his looks. The creature also questions human society itself: why people are cruel, why they murder, why there is inequality in wealth and status, and why property and money are so important.
- **Abandonment**  
  The creature's existence is defined by abandonment: by his creator, the cottagers and society.
