## Désirée's Baby

Désirée's Baby is a short story about multi-ethnic relationships written by American writer Kate Chopin (born Katherine O'Flaherty) in 1893.

Chopin was a part of the **creole social elite**. These were wealthy families in Louisiana who came from French and Spanish settlers, who kept their European culture and traditions.

The story is set in L'Abri, Louisiana, on a plantation.

### Historical context

The story is set before the American Civil War (1861-1865) during the **Antebellum** period (1820-1855). During this period, there was significant tension between the Northern and Southern states. Northern states were free states where slavery was prohibited, while slavery was still practiced in the Southern states. This created growing conflict between the states, eventually leading to the American Civil War. The Northern states won the war, and slavery was abolished (but racism persisted).

### Summary

Désirée is the adopted daughter of Monsieur and Madame Valmondé. When she was a baby, she was found abandoned in the shadow of a stone pillar by Monsieur Valmondé. Désirée marries Armand Aubigny, and they have a child together. Armand was a slave owner, but he became kinder and softer after he married Désirée and after they had the baby. However, after a few months, Armand's behavior suddenly changes. He avoids being with the baby and becomes very harsh toward the slaves again.  
One afternoon, Désirée is in her room when she notices that her baby looks a lot like one of the quadroons (a person who is 1/4 Black). Armand enters her room and accuses Désirée of not being white (because her heritage is unknown, since she was found abandoned).  
Désirée writes to her mother, who tells her she should come home with the baby. Armand also tells her to leave. Désirée leaves with the baby, and she is never seen again.  
A few weeks later, Armand burns all of Désirée's belongings. In the drawer where the letters between Armand and Désirée were kept, he finds a letter from his mother to his father, revealing that Armand is the one who is part Black.

### Themes

- **Identity** and **ethnicity**  
  Identity and ethnicity are portrayed as the most important aspects of a person. For example, Armand sends away Désirée and the baby purely because of ethnicity.
- **Racism**
- **Love/marriage**
- **Sexism**
