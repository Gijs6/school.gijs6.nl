## Désirée's Baby

**Désirée's Baby** is a short story about multi-ethnic relationships written by American writer **Kate Chopin** (born Katherine O'Flaherty) in 1893.

Chopin was a part of the **creole social elite**. These were wealthy families in Louisiana who came from French and Spanish settlers, who kept their European culture and traditions.

The story is set in L'Abri, Louisiana, on a plantation.

### Historical context

The story is set before the American Civil War (1861-1865) during the **Antebellum** period (1820-1855). During this period, there was significant tension between the Northern and Southern states. Northern states were free states where slavery was prohibited, while slavery was still practiced in the Southern states. This created growing conflict between the states, eventually leading to the American Civil War. The Northern states won the war, and slavery was abolished (but racism persisted).

### Summary

Désirée is the adopted daughter of Monsieur and Madame Valmondé. When she was a baby, she was found abandoned in the shadow of a stone pillar by Monsieur Valmondé. Désirée marries Armand Aubigny, and they have a child together. Armand was a slave owner, but he became kinder and softer after he married Désirée and after they had the baby. However, after a few months, Armand's behavior suddenly changes. He avoids being with the baby and becomes very harsh toward the slaves again.  
One afternoon, Désirée is in her room when she notices that her baby looks a lot like one of the quadroons (a person who is 1/4 Black). Armand enters her room and accuses Désirée of not being white (because her heritage is unknown, since she was found abandoned).  
Désirée writes to her mother, who tells her she should come home with the baby. Armand also tells her to leave. Désirée leaves with the baby, and she is never seen again.  
A few weeks later, Armand burns all of Désirée's belongings. In the drawer where the letters between Armand and Désirée were kept, he finds a letter from his mother to his father, revealing that Armand is the one who is part Black.

### Themes

- **Identity** and **ethnicity**  
  Identity and ethnicity are portrayed as the most important aspects of a person. For example, Armand sends away Désirée and the baby purely because of ethnicity.
- **Racism**
- **Love/marriage**
- **Sexism**

## The Yellow Wallpaper

**The Yellow Wallpaper** is a short story written by American writer **Charlotte Perkins Gilman** in 1892. The story is an important work of **feminist literature**.

The story is a collection of first-person narrated journal entries.

### Historical context

The story is set during the **fin de siècle** (end of century) period. This period was characterized by **decay**, **anxiety**, and **fear of the future**.
People began to question the authority of religion, morality, and traditional gender roles. There was a growing fascination with the mind and dreams.

### Summary

A young woman and her husband (John) spend the summer at a mansion, where the narrator is confined to an upstairs nursery. Her husband had imposed a **rest cure** on her after she suffered a **postpartum depression** (depression after giving birth). John is belittling of her illness and dismissive of her perspective. He believes she is not really sick. The woman keeps a secret journal to "relieve her mind."

The woman develops an obsession with the yellow wallpaper in the nursery. She finds the pattern disturbing. John worries about her obsession and refuses to replace the wallpaper.
As her obsession grows, the sub-pattern of the wallpaper begins to resemble a woman "stooping down and creeping."

Her obsession intensifies. She believes the wallpaper is moving, and her imagination becomes completely focused on it. She is losing touch with reality. She can smell the paper throughout the whole house. She believes that a woman trapped inside the paper is making it move. She descends into total madness and even sees that woman outside her window. She starts to identify with the woman in the wallpaper.

She starts peeling off the wallpaper during the night because she suspects that John knows about her obsession. The next day, she starts biting and tearing the paper to free the trapped woman inside.
By the end, the woman has gone completely insane. She is convinced that there are many women creeping around, and that she herself has come out of the wallpaper. When John breaks into the locked room and sees the full horror of the situation, he faints in the doorway.

### Themes

- **Mental health and insanity**  
  The story shows how the rest cure and isolation drive the narrator to madness. Her descent into insanity is portrayed through her obsession with the wallpaper.
- **The rest cure**  
  The rest cure was a real medical treatment prescribed to women in the 19th century. The story criticizes this treatment by showing how it worsens the narrator's condition instead of curing it. Charlotte Perkins Gilman herself was placed on a rest cure after suffering from postpartum depression. She wrote this story as a critique of the treatment and to raise awareness about its harmful effects.
- **Gender roles**  
  John dismisses his wife's concerns and he controls every aspect of her life. The collapse of John at the end symbolizes the collapse of his power.
- **Freedom**  
  The woman in the wallpaper represents the narrator's desire to break free from her confinement. By tearing down the wallpaper, she symbolically frees herself.
- **Perception vs. reality**  
  Because the narrator is unreliable, readers are forced to question what is real and what is her imagination. Her changing perception of the wallpaper reflects her deteriorating mental state.
